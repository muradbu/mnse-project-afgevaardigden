- We're creating an Ansible Playbook for our school project
- We're configuring 3 routers in the server room: `aggregate-dc`, `aggregate-noord`, `aggregate-zuid`
- They're Cisco routers
- Make logical router-id's per router
- They all need: BGP, OSPF and IP connectivity
    - `aggregate-dc` connects `aggregate-noord` and `aggregate-zuid`
- `aggregate-dc` info:
    - AS 65501
    - GigabitEthernet0/0/0.455 10.255.0.49 255.255.255.252 (p2p to `aggregate-noord`)
    - GigabitEthernet0/0/1.355 10.255.0.45 255.255.255.252 (p2p to `aggregate-zuid`)
    - Management IP for SSH: 10.99.2.51
- `aggregate-noord` info:
    - AS 65503
    - GigabitEthernet0/0/0.455 10.255.0.50 255.255.255.252 (p2p to `aggregate-dc`)
    - Management IP for SSH: 10.99.2.50
- `aggregate-zuid` info:
    - AS 65502
    - GigabitEthernet0/0/1.355 10.255.0.46 255.255.255.252 (p2p to `aggregate-dc`)
    - Management IP for SSH: 10.4.0.5
